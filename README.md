One of the problems in optimal control is Output Feedback(OPFB).  This  scheme  allows  control  design  withoutgoing through full state feedback. The control objectives usingthe  OPFB  scheme  are  (1)  to  fulfill  the  stability  conditionsof  the  closed  loop  system,  (2)  the  control  system  is  able  totrack  the  desired  reference  signal
